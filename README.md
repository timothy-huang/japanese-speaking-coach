# Japanese Speaking Coach for Codex

Japanese Speaking Coach is a voice-first rehearsal plugin for intermediate Japanese learners. It practices real-life interactions, extended explanations, and spoken summaries through a repeatable loop: attempt, focused repair, replay, and variation.

Coaching can be delivered in the learner's preferred language while the speaking task remains in Japanese.

## What it supports

- Real-life conversations in Japan, including phone and in-person scenarios
- Explanations adapted to a listener, purpose, and level of formality
- Spoken summaries of Japanese source material
- Focused feedback without interrupting every error
- Practice with misunderstandings, clarification, and recovery

## Install from a public Git repository

After this folder is published as a Git repository, add the repository as a marketplace and install the plugin:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git
codex plugin add japanese-speaking-coach@japanese-speaking-tools
```

Replace `OWNER/REPOSITORY` with the repository's GitHub path. Start a new Codex task after installation so the skill is loaded.

## Install from a local checkout

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/japanese-speaking-coach-marketplace
codex plugin add japanese-speaking-coach@japanese-speaking-tools
```

## Try it

- “Rehearse a Japanese phone call and coach me in Traditional Chinese.”
- “Help me explain an idea in Japanese and coach me in Spanish.”
- “Recommend a Japanese speaking task and use English for feedback.”

Voice mode is recommended. The plugin will ask for a genuine first attempt before offering a polished model.
